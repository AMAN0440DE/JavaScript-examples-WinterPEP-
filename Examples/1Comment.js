 * JS Data types: ->
 * Number, String, Undefined(Absecence of value (we must not use it , use by JS compiler)), 
 * Null(Absecence of value,(we explicitly make it null)), boolean, big int, Symbols
 * 
 * When variable is created it allocates us a memory in RAM with hexadecimal address and we need to store that address somewhere
